# Mockolate TextMate Bundle

A TextMate bundle for working with [Mockolate][mockolate].

Features:

 * A very small selection of snippets to get you cooking
 * There's only one thing to remember - type mock, press tab
 
Snippets are scope related, so they'll insert the relevant code based on the location of your
caret.
